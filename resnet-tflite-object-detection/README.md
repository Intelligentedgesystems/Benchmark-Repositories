## Introduction
This project utilizes the ResNet architecture for object detection tasks. The model is trained to identify various objects in images with high accuracy.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Intelligentedgesystems/Benchmark-Repositories.git
cd Benchmark-Repositories/Resnet-Object-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the object detection model on your images, use the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```
