## Introduction
ResNet (Residual Network) is a popular deep learning architecture used for image classification tasks. This repository provides a ResNet-based model for classifying images into different categories.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Intelligentedgesystems/Benchmark-Repositories.git
cd Benchmark-Repositories/Resnet-Image-Classification
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the model for image classification, follow these steps:

1. Download the model files from the link provided in the [Model Files](#model-files) section.
2. Place the downloaded model files in the appropriate directory.
3. Run the classification script:
    ```bash
    python test2.py 
    ```
